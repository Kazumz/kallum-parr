# Obsolete and Deprecated
A lot has gone on in the last 3 years in terms of my growth and development, this includes how I style websites and implement them.

Therefore I have chosen to deprecate this website because I feel it no longer represents me as a developer appropriately.

In place of this, I have created a new business card style website and will be hosting this at the same domain name. This repository is public on my GitHub also.

## Major Technologies:
<ul>
    <li>
        Gatsby (Site Generation)
    </li>
    <li>
        React 16.13.x
    </li>
    <li>
        TypeScript 3.8.3
    </li>
    <li>
        SCSS with SCSS Modules
    </li>
    <li>
        ESLint (JavaScript, TypeScript, React Hooks)
    </li>
</ul>

## Key Points:
<ul>
    <li>
        I have used Gatsby here as the Site Generator over CRA as it provides out of the box GraphQL, SSR, and excellent plugin support. This is fantastic for getting up and running fast without thinking too much about environment maintenance.
    </li>
    <li>
        Ever since learning to develop in React, I have become extremely fond of it. It's easy to understand and use and doesn't force you down a path like Frameworks do, because it's a Library! With support from Facebook, it's quickly growing to become the most popular and best web development tool out there.
    </li>
    <li>
        Coming from a C# background and moving to Web Technologies, I was aware of JavaScript and it's looseness. I wanted something that could provide me the confidence that C# could, so TypeScript was the answer to that. Ever since using TypeScript and JavaScript, I wouldn't recommend ever developing a project without TypeScript. Even for small scale projects, the benefit of typing your code and being strict means you're less likely to find smells and bugs. It allows your project to be scalable and enforce consistent code with confidence.
