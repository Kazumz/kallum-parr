        "content-one": "I originally became interested in development/programming while playing Grand Theft Auto San Andreas Multiplayer (SA:MP), I had created my own server and met a few friends. From there we wanted to expand and introduce unique plugins to the server to separate us from the rest. During it's peak popularity, this game had thousands of servers online - separating yourself was quite important.",
        "content-two": "I started looking in to plugins and realised that in order to develop plugins, you needed to learn PAWN and LUA. To start, I looked in to existing open source plugins and patched code together from different repositories until I created something that worked for me. The first plugin I created was something that involved moving 3D fence gates to provide access to certain areas for players.",
        "content-three": "From there, I developed a few more plugins. By doing this, the popularity of the server grew so much that we weren't able to afford the upkeep, we were stuck with a 32 slot server that was constantly full. It was a challenge to connect at all.",
        "content-four": "I played this game for a few years before moving on to something called Garry's Mod which was built on the Source Engine by Valve in the late 2000's. To this day it's still used in extremely popular games.",
        "content-five": "Much like the previous story, I started with a small server and built it up to be something special. However, I started to move more in to the Roleplaying genre. Fortunately, there were existing plugins for this game that were already well developed. From this generation, I learnt to manage a team of moderators and dealing with money that was provided by donation for ranks and was reinvested back in to the server to we could add more slots for players to join. From the amount of money gathered here, we were able to avoid paying out of our own pockets towards the upkeep of the server. This ran for about a year.",
        "content-six": "At this point, I was about to move in to College from School (2010). There was a new game on the block, it was called Minecraft. This game became incredibly popular in an extremely short amount of time. It's one of the bestselling games, even today.",
        "content-seven": "This generation is what I consider to be the pinnacle of my time gaming. I spent long hours working hard to develop a server that provided a good experience for everyone. I announced the move to Minecraft to the following I accumulated from Garry's Mod and from here, embarked on a year long journey.",
        "content-eight": "During this time, management took over everything. It was important to develop and install plugins to deter other players destroying the work of others; in the early days of Minecraft this was a constant challenge. Alongside this, I had to manage a team of moderators and the income from the server. Looking back on saved records, we would regularly earn between £50-£150 per month. This was provided from donations and was reinvested back in to the upkeep and development of the server.",
        "content-nine": "Unfortunately, during this time, the management and development of this server started to conflict with my College studies. I was a year in to my studies, and wasn't doing particularly well. After leaving school with a small amount of GCSE's, it was time to prove that I could develop in an educational and professional sense.",
        "content-ten": "I cut ties with Minecraft and shut the server down; before doing so I backed everything up. I helped facilitate a move to another server. We had no ties to this other server, but it looked like a place where our existing player base could go and enjoy like they did on my server. From this point onwards, I've focused on my education and professional development."
